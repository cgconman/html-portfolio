<h3>28 Days Later</h3>
<p>I enjoy this zombie thriller as it is a hopeful protagonist in a bleak setting. It pits multiple values against each other, and how it plays out is gory and beautiful.</p>

<h3>Mad Max: Fury Road</h3>
 
    <p>Stunning visual story, that uses a visual medium to tell a weird and bizarre story and the desperate people in the post apocalypse.</p>

<h3>Alien</h3>
    
<p>A masterpiece of horror storytelling where no character makes bad decisions. The protagonists are up against seemingly insurmountable odds, and an unkown corporate interest. The survival of man vs a species that is only intent on killing, shows what true human character and perseverence really is.</p>
